\section{Background}
What is the question we are asking? Has anyone asked it before? What did they do
and find? What are we going to do that's different and what will we find?

\section{Data & Methods} 

Cause of death classification and age reporting are considered to be inaccurate in death registration in older ages. For this reason, we truncate analysis at age 75. This is also a reasonable decision because most changes in life expectancy are likely due to changes in mortality patterns below the age of 75. There are different ways to summarize mortality conditions in specified age ranges, and we choose to focus on temporary life expectancy between the ages of 0 and 75 (Arriaga, 1982), at times breaking this quantity into large age groups.

Exposures came from ___

Death counts were tabulated by the authors based on official microdata available from ___

\subsection{Classification of causes of death}
The period of years covered in this study spans both ICD 9 and ICD 10, â€¦. find language... based on XXX (2013)
Causes were grouped into _ categories based 

Data quality and limitation (appendix?)

\subsection{Best practices lifetable}
This method was first proposed by Vallin \& Mesle (2008)


\subsection{temporary life expectancy}
\subsection{decomposing differences in temp life expectancy}



\section{State trends in departures from best practices temp e(0)}
Small multiples maps (time series of maps)

\section{Age and cause contributions to differences}

This will show a few small multiples figures, tbd 

\section{Discussion}
Talk about the role of homicide and other major causes. How many years of life
were lost? (not just expectancy). maybe..

\section{Conclusions}
Homicide is a public health concern..
